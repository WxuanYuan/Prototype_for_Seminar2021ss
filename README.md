# Prototype_for_Seminar2021ss
This prototype is about obtaining the gradient of a quantum circuit with parameter shift rule and its possible use cases.
All codes are written in .ipynb, you can run them directly using github. If github cannot execute the code completely, you can run it on IBM's online quantum lab:
https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/lab/

Code list and its corresponding part in slidesï¼š
1. PSR_Visualisation.ipynb: Parameter shift rule visualization. (page 23)
2. GradeintDecentMethod.ipynb: Code for gradient decent methoid example2. (page 25~26)
3. DataForContourMap.ipynb: Data used to generate contour map in Matlab (page 29)
4. MachineLearning.ipynb: Code for Machine learning example2 (page 38~40)
5. 9_layer_circuit.ipynb: A bigger example

I've only uploaded the code for complicated examples. Code for simple examples is nothing but a simplified version.
