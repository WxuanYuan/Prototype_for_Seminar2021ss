Differentiable quantum circult simulation

All codes are written in .ipynb, you can run them directly using github.

Code list and its corresponding part in presentationï¼š
1. PSR_Visualisation.ipynb: Parameter shift rule visualization. (page 23)
2. Code for gradient decent methoid example2. (page 25~26)
3. DataForContourMap.ipynb: Data used to generate contour map in Matlab (page 29)
4. Code for Machine learning example2 (page 38~40)

I only uploaded the code for complecated examples. Code for simple examples is nothing but a simplified version.
